# TrainSeating Project
 
## Description
This Java application allows users to select and reserve seats from a predefined seating grid, such as for a cinema or airline. It displays available seats, takes user input for seat selection, and updates the seating grid accordingly.

## Features
- Interactive seat selection from a two-dimensional array representing the seating grid.
- Updates and displays the seating grid with the user's selection marked.
- Supports multiple seat selections in a session.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
3. Compile the Java files: `javac SeatingReservation.java`
4. Run the compiled class: `java SeatingReservation`

## Usage
When prompted, enter the seat you wish to select (e.g., '2B'). The system will update the seating grid to mark your selection and prevent it from being selected by others.
